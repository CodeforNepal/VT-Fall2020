**Group 2: Information Hub Website**

*About*

Our group created a Wix website to centralize the documentation created in Dr. Sweta Baniya's ENGL 3814: Creating User Documentation course.
In this GitHub repo folder, you will find the user documentation by category.
Each topic has two files: a PDF file and a .docx file.
A couple of topics do not have written documentation (so they only have a video) because some students did two topics during the course.


*How to View the Website*

Wix does not allow users to download the code for the website directly, so to view the live website, go to:
https://mongoose0812.wixsite.com/cfndocumentation


*How to View Topic Videos*

All topic videos are located in a shared Google Drive folder.
Anybody should be able to access the folder with the following link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZxaP7oKO4nkgq-cKRC8ZzrXlu1EkLMbC?usp=sharing

Note: The topics Google Docs and Microsoft Excel Functions do not have video documentation.

Similarly, Microsoft Paint and Creating Websites with Wix do not have written documentation.


There are 19 total topics.
